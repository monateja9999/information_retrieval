CSCI 572 - INFORMATION RETRIEVAL AND WEB SEARCH ENGINES - HOME WORK 5


Dear Grader/Course Producer/Instructor,

Q1. I have provided the Screenshots for question 1 along with 3 Prompts and respective outputs as Query1.png, Query2.png and Query3.png in a folder called "Q1". As the generated outputs are huge, I have also added a folder called "Screenshots_Continuation" where you can see the output continuations for Query2 and Query3.

I have also included a folder called Exercise - with 4 LLMs where you can see that prompt is being sent to 4 LLMs (2 apart from what was given in professor's description).
 
Q2. I have provided the Screenshots for question 2 along with 2 Prompts and respective outputs as Query1.png and Query2.png in a folder called "Q2". As the generated outputs are huge, I have also added a folder called "Screenshots_Continuation" where you can see the output continuations for Query1 and Query2.

Setup - includes the proof and screenshots of installation and execution on laptop.


***** THANK YOU *****
